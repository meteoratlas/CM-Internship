# Critical Mass Application

## Project Examples

### Transformations Game (https://github.com/meteoratlas/Project-Earth)

A project we are currently working on in the EvolveU Full Stack Developer program. This game, made for MindFuel, teaches middle-school students how Cartesian transformations work. Players must use logical thinking to move a triangle across the grid to the goal by applying transforms, rotations, and reflections. I am the team lead and lead programmer for this project, contributing the transformation logic as well as much of the rendering and game logic. Built in React and JavaScript, using the Pixi.js library for graphics.

### WebSocket Chat (https://github.com/meteoratlas/WebSocketChat)

A work-in-progress project I am currently designing and programming to explore WebSockets. It uses JavaScript and Node to allow multiple users to chat in real-time with each other. It includes functionality such as selectable usernames and notices when other users are typing.

### Interactive Story (https://github.com/meteoratlas/interactive-story)

A work-in-progress interactive story game built in React, designed to evoke modern browser-based choose your own adventure style stories as well as text adventure games. I did both the writing and programming, with the goal of using modern React features such as hooks and context. An incomplete version is available at https://meteoratlas.github.io/interactive-story/

## Inspiring Projects

### ORCA (https://github.com/hundredrabbits/Orca)

Orca is a sophisticated live-coding environment, primarily focused on transmitting data to audio applications. That such a complicated project could be produced in simple JavaScript is inspiring to me, as well as the idea of creating something that in turn allows others to express their creativity. In particular, the combination of simple structures to produce complex output is very inspirational.

### React Context (https://www.robinwieruch.de/react-context)

Robin's tutorials are excellent. They not only clearly explain the technical implementation of the article's subject, but also the conceptual design behind it and why you might want to use it. He also is excellent at explaining both his code and process, two valuable skills for programming that I always hope to further improve upon. This particular article goes into React's context, a topic I have been exploring recently that is well explained here.

### Are Pop Lyrics Getting More Repetitive? (https://pudding.cool/2017/05/song-repetition/)

An article about the perceived simplicity of modern song lyrics brought to life through web technology. Not only is the site beautiful (particularly its typography), but it reacts to the user's scrolling to create an experience that feels both futuristic and natural. The visualizations of the compression algorithm being applied are especially exciting. The computer science approach to analyzing the problem is also very interesting to me.

## Focus

I would be most interested in continuing to learn about full stack development. I would like to enhance my skills in server-side programming if possible, and would also like to potentially make a web application.
